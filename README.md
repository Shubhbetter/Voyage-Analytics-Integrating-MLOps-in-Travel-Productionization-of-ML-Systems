Travel Analytics and Machine Learning
Capstone Project - Travel Data Analysis and Model Deployment
-----------------------------------------------------

üìñ Introduction:
This project focuses on leveraging data analytics and machine learning to revolutionize travel and tourism experiences. Using datasets on users, flights, and hotels, we aim to build and deploy models for predicting flight prices, classifying user gender, and recommending hotels.

-----------------------------------------------------

üìã Project Objectives:
Regression Model Development: Predict flight prices using a regression model based on the flights dataset.
Streamlit App: Develop a streamlit webapp for real-time flight price predictions.
Containerization: Package and deploy the model using Docker.
Model Tracking: Use MLFlow for tracking and managing model versions.
Gender Classification: Deploy a model for classifying user gender.
Travel Recommendation: Build a recommendation system for hotel suggestions and create a Streamlit app for interactive insights.
